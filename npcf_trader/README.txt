Mod - Trader NPC [npcf_trader]
------------------------------

License Source Code: 2013 Stuart Jones - LGPL v2.1

License Textures: WTFPL

Depends: npcf

Provides a quantity based exchange system. The owner can set a given number of exchanges.
This would likely be best used in conjunction with one of the physical currency mods.

	Buy [default:mese] Qty [1] - Sell [default:gold_ingot] Qty [10]
	Buy [default:gold_ingot] Qty [20] - Sell [default:mese] Qty [1]

Note that the NPC's owner cannot trade with their own NPC, that would be rather pointless anyway.
